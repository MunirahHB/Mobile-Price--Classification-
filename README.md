# Mobile Price Classification Project

## Project Overview
This project involves building a classification model to predict mobile phone price ranges based on their hardware specifications. The goal is to categorize devices into four distinct price tiers, from low-cost to premium.

## Dataset Analysis
The dataset includes 2,000 mobile phone records with features such as:
* **Performance**: RAM, Internal Memory, and Processor Speed.
* **Specs**: Battery Power, Camera Megapixels, and Screen Resolution.
* **Connectivity**: Support for 4G, 3G, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.

## Implementation Methodology
1. **Data Loading**: Reading the dataset using Pandas.
2. **Preprocessing**: Preparing features for the model.
3. **Data Splitting**: Partitioning data into Training and Testing sets (80/20).
4. **Model Training**: Implementing the classification algorithm.
5. **Evaluation**: Measuring accuracy performance.
